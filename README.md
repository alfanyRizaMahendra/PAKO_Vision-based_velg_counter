# PAKO_Vision-based_velg_counter
Velg counter system based on vision read by Utilizing python as the programming language, pytorch with Yolo V8 pre-train model, custom dataset, training section using google colab, deploy model in the private PC (using CPU-only), and update the read data transaction to mysql.

This project's configuration : 
1. Training dataset : 377 images 
2. Validation dataset : 32 images
3. Testing data : velg_compilation.mp4
4. image resolution : 416x416

Detection Result :
epoch       = 75
mAP50       = 97,2%
mAP50 - 95  = 85,6%
